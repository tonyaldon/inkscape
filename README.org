* About
This repository contains my training work on Inkscape.

1. /Images/, /drawings/, /schemas/, all kind of /pictures/ are really
   powerful when it comes:
   - to tell *STORIES*,
   - to convey *EMOTIONS* and
   - to disseminate *MESSAGES*.
2. Well done, /images/ are easy:
   - to *UNDERSTAND* and
   - to *ASSIMILATE*.
3. They can *SUMMARIZE* and *SIMPLIFY* elaborated /ideas/ and /contents/.
4. They can help you *ENHANCED* /videos/ (after all, videos are just
   many images sequentialy exposed in a fixe order - for a video
   with a 25fps configuration, you are viewing 25 images per seconds
   1500 images per minutes.)

** <2020-12-30 Wed>: Drone Icon Vector Tutorial
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pICn4QTf3pQ][Inkscape for Beginners: Drone Icon Vector Tutorial]]
- [[./inkscape-beginner-tutorial/drone-icon-vector-tutorial.svg][drone icon vector tutorial]] (svg file)
- main commands:
  - ~ToolStar~: (hold ~ctrl+shift~ keys to make regular form)
  - In Stroke style, select ~rounded join~ and ~rounded cap~.
  - ~ToolArc~: (hold ~ctrl+shift~ keys to make regular form, and the
    center of the object doesn't move)
  - opacity to 50%
  - ~EditDuplicate~
  - ~ToolDropper~
  - In the toolbar (at the top) when a circle is selected, deselect
    the icon ~scale the stroke width by the same proportion~.  This
    allow you to scale down/up the circle (changing the radius) but
    not changing the thikness of the stroke.
  - ~ToolRect~
  - ~SelectionCutPath~ (cut with limit of the above object and keep
    the under object)
  - ~SelectionUnion~
  - ~ObjectFlipHorizontally~
  - ~ObjectRotate90~
  - ~SelectionGroup~
  - ~SelectionUnGroup~
** [2020-12-22 Tue]: Infinite Loop Icon
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9WLZgfr-NQ][Inkscape for Beginners: Infinite Loop Icon]]
- [[./inkscape-beginner-tutorial/infinite-loop-icon.svg][infinite loop icon]] (svg file)
- main commands:
  - ~ToolRect~
  - ~ObjectToPath~
  - ~EditPastSize~
  - ~ToolNode~
  - ~insert new nodes into selected segment~
  - ~make selected node corner~
  - ~EditDuplicate~
  - ~ObjectFlipHorizontally~
  - In Stroke style, select ~rounded join~ and ~rounded cap~.
  - ~StrokeToPath~
  - ~SelectionUnion~
  - ~ToolPen~
  - ~ObjectFlipVertically~
  - ~SelectionDiff~
** [2020-12-17 Thu]: Vector Abstract Background
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hcxuwDKo6I][Inkscape Beginner Tutorial: Vector Abstract Background Tutorial]]
- [[./inkscape-beginner-tutorial/vector-abstract-background.svg][vector abstract background]] (svg file)
- main commands:
  - ~ObjectToPath~
  - ~DialogFillStroke > Mesh gradient~
  - ~ToggleToolbox~
  - ~Edit Meshes~ (part of the tool boxes)
  - ~DialogLayers~
  - ~new layer~
  - ~ToolArc~ (hold ~ctrl~ and ~shift~ keys to make a perfect circle)
  - play with /opacity/
  - By holding ~ctrl~ key hand moving an object with the mooth, it
    lockdown the movement horizontaly or verticaly respecting (x,y)
    position of the starting point of the object
  - By holding the ~left mooth click~ and pressing ~space~ you
    duplicate an object
  - ~lock layer~
  - ~extensions > generate from path > voronoi diagrams > delaunay
    triangulation~
  - ~SelectionUnGroup~
** [2020-12-16 Wed]: Inner Shadow Effect
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1SGxjMWbZs][Inkscape Beginner Tutorial: Inner Shadow Effect]]
- [[./inkscape-beginner-tutorial/inkscape-beginner-tutorial-inner-shadow-effect.svg][inner shadow effect]] (svg file)
- main commands:
  - ~ObjectToPath~
  - ~SelectionDiff~ (remove the intersection of the two object and
    keep the other part of the one below)
  - ~object > clip > set~ (intersect between two object and keep style
    of the one below)
  - Add 1% /blur/ and play with /opacity/
  - ~object > clip > release~ (a kind of reverse operation of ~object >
    clip > set~)
