* About
This repository contains my training work on Inkscape.

1. /Images/, /drawings/, /schemas/, all kind of /pictures/ are really
   powerful when it comes:
   - to tell *STORIES*,
   - to convey *EMOTIONS* and
   - to disseminate *MESSAGES*.
2. Well done, /images/ are easy:
   - to *UNDERSTAND* and
   - to *ASSIMILATE*.
3. They can *SUMMARIZE* and *SIMPLIFY* elaborated /ideas/ and /contents/.
4. They can help you *ENHANCED* /videos/ (after all, videos are just
   many images sequentialy exposed in a fixe order - for a video
   with a 25fps configuration, you are viewing 25 images per seconds
   1500 images per minutes.)

- main commands:
  - ~ObjectToPath~
  - ~SelectionDiff~ (remove the intersection of the two object and
    keep the other part of the one below)
  - ~object > clip > set~ (intersect between two object and keep style
    of the one below)
  - Add 1% /blur/ and play with /opacity/
  - ~object > clip > release~ (a kind of reverse operation of ~object >
    clip > set~)
